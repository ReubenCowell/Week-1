The client/server model:

A server is a computer on a network that provides a resource that can be used by any authorised client station.

The servers are 'the boss', they hold power and can grant or deny any request.
Servers are usually always on and connected to the internet so that users can access their resources and services at any time. There are many types of server:

The most common type of server you will interact with is a web server; web servers store and provide the webpages we browse. This course is stored on a server; every time you complete a step, your device will request the next one.
Email servers direct email to the intended recipient and sometimes filter out spam.
File transfer servers provide files to users, like those that provide the songs we listen to on Spotify.


A client is a computer or computer-controlled device that provides a user with access to a network.

the client can make requests to servers and display the results, they don't have to always be on, they can connect to a
server at any time.

Some clients are dedicated hardware devices, for example speed cameras. They capture photos and licence plate numbers
and send a request to a central server to store and process them; that is their entire functionality.

A lot of applications turn your smartphone into a client, not processing or computing much itself but instead making
requests to servers.
