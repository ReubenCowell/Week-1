An introduction to sockets


sockets are not physical, they are abstract and a tool that helps make communication simpler

They are in pairs and are like a tube with two ports at each end,
whatever is in one end of the tube can be taken out the other

The socket is defined as a mechanism for machine-to-machine communication.

A programmer doesnâ€™t need to know how a network works, or how data is transmitted;

Socket is used how to refer to a socket the used internet protocol and particularly the transmission control protocol

they are key to allow applications to communicate with other apps through the transport layer

there are lots of types of sockets
he Berkeley sockets API is the most widely used and a version exists in most general-purpose programming languages.

a standard for the life cycle (process) for a socket:

Open it
Read from it
Write to it
Close it

Server Socket:

A socket for a server is always waiting, when a client connects, it deals with request:

To create a server socket:

First create a socket of a specific type (protocol)
Then bind the socket to the network address where connections will be made
Set the socket to listen for a client to make a connection
Wait for a connection, accept it, and create a new socket to manage the connection between the server and this client; every client that connects to the server will get its own connection socket
Then send and receive (recv) data over the connection socket
Finally, close the socket when new connections are no longer needed

Client socket:

when a client server socket is waiting for a connection, a client server can connect to it

Creating a client socket is a simpler process, but there are still defined steps:

First create a socket that is of the same type as the socket you wish to connect to
Then connect the socket to the network address of the server socket
You then send and receive (recv) data over the socket
Finally, close the connection when complete
