# you can use this to connect to the server socket in socket_server.py

import socket  # imports the socket module

client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)  # sets up a socket with ip and TCP, the same as
# the server one
client_socket.connect(("127.0.0.1", 8081))  # connects to the ip and port
print("Connected")

data = client_socket.recv(1024)  # data is received and added to the data variable
# The value 1024 is the maximum number of bytes that should be read at one time. If more than 1,024 bytes had been
# sent, subsequent calls to recv would receive the rest of the data.
message = data.decode()  # decodes the message
print(message)  # prints the message

client_socket.close()  # it is good practice to close sockets
